# Diophantine_Equation_2_Python
**Objective:** To find whether or not the quantity requested by the user is viable option when ordering chicken nuggets at McD. And suggest the closest feasible and the least expensive option available.

**Assumption:** chicken nuggets are purchased in quantities of 6, 9, and 22. Means, there is no combination of options that will allow you to purchase 23 nuggets.

**Diophantine equations used: 1)**  6a + 9b + 22c = n (for number of nuggets)

                            **2)**  3a + 4b + 9c = cost (for finding cost, where 6-piece = $3, 9-piece = $4, and 22-piece = $9)

**Expected Result:** find the values of a, b, and c. And suggest the least priced option.
